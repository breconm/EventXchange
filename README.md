## Project Overview
Created for the fCC 2025 Summer Hackathon, EventXchange is a community-based app centred around connecting you with amazing events hosted by like-minded individuals. Users can create, delete, and schedule events at their creative leisure, as well RSVP to other users' events.

```git clone git@github.com:freeCodeCamp-2025-Summer-Hackathon/EventXchange.git```
2. Install front-end and back-end dependencies.
```npm run deps```

### Environment Variables
1. Create and connect to a MongoDB Atlas cluster.
2. Navigate from root folder to server folder.
```cd server```
3. Create env file with two variables: DB_URI and SESSION_SECRET
4. Populate the seed database.
